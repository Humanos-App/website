# Meta Tags Rules
# Title, description, and canonical link

---

## RULE: meta.title_present_unique
Severity: CRITICAL

Every page must have a non-empty, unique <title>.

Applies to: text/html
Minimum characters: 8

Why: Title is the most important on-page SEO element. Duplicate titles confuse search engines.

---

## RULE: meta.title_length
Severity: WARN

Title should be 30-65 characters (ideal: 50-60).

Applies to: text/html
Min: 30 chars
Max: 65 chars

Why: Titles longer than ~60 chars get truncated in search results.

---

## RULE: meta.description_present
Severity: CRITICAL

Every page must have a meta description.

Applies to: text/html
Required: <meta name="description" content="...">

Why: Description appears in search results. Missing descriptions hurt click-through rates.

---

## RULE: meta.description_length
Severity: WARN

Meta description should be 90-180 characters (ideal: 140-160).

Applies to: text/html
Min: 90 chars
Max: 180 chars

Why: Descriptions longer than ~160 chars get truncated in search results.

---

## RULE: link.canonical_present_single
Severity: CRITICAL

Every page must have exactly ONE canonical link.

Applies to: text/html
Required: <link rel="canonical" href="...">
Must be: absolute URL (not relative)

Why: Multiple or missing canonicals confuse search engines about which URL to index.

---

## RULE: link.canonical_matches_normalization
Severity: CRITICAL

Canonical URL must follow normalization rules.

Check:
- Uses https://
- Uses humanos.id (not www, not vercel.app)
- Follows trailing slash policy
- No index.html
- No tracking parameters

Why: Canonical must point to the "correct" version of the URL.
