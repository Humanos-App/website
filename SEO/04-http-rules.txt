# HTTP Rules
# Status codes, redirects, and protocol enforcement

---

## RULE: http.status_must_200_html
Severity: CRITICAL

All indexable HTML pages must return HTTP 200.

Applies to: text/html content
Allowed status codes: 200

Why: Search engines only index pages that return 200. Other codes signal errors or redirects.

---

## RULE: http.no_soft_404
Severity: CRITICAL

No soft-404 pages (200 response with "not found" content).

Applies to: text/html content

Check for patterns:
- "page not found"
- "not found"
- "404"
- "doesn't exist"
- "does not exist"

Minimum body text: 120 characters

Why: Soft-404s waste crawl budget and confuse search engines about real content.

---

## RULE: http.redirect_chain_max_1
Severity: CRITICAL

No redirect chains over 1 hop.

Applies to: all URLs
Max hops allowed: 1

Why: Redirect chains waste crawl budget and slow down users. Direct links to final destinations.

---

## RULE: http.no_redirect_loops
Severity: CRITICAL

No redirect loops.

Applies to: all URLs

Why: Redirect loops are broken links that never resolve.

---

## RULE: url.force_https
Severity: CRITICAL

HTTPS must be enforced on all URLs.

Applies to: all URLs

Why: HTTPS is a ranking signal and required for security.

---

## RULE: url.canonical_host_enforced
Severity: CRITICAL

Single canonical host must be enforced.

Canonical host: humanos.id
Applies to: all URLs

Why: Prevents duplicate content between www and non-www versions.
