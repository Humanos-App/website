# Links and Assets Rules
# Internal linking, orphan pages, and images

---

## RULE: links.no_broken_internal
Severity: CRITICAL

No broken internal links.

Applies to: text/html
Timeout per link: 10000ms
Allowed status codes: 200, 204

Check: All <a href="..."> pointing to same domain must resolve.

Why: Broken links hurt user experience and waste crawl budget.

---

## RULE: links.no_orphan_pages
Severity: WARN

No orphan pages (in sitemap but not linked from anywhere).

Applies to: site-wide check
Source: sitemap
Must be zero: true

Why: Orphan pages are hard to discover and may not get indexed.

---

## RULE: assets.images_alt_text
Severity: WARN

Images should have alt text.

Applies to: text/html
Allow empty alt: false

Check: All <img> tags have non-empty alt attribute.

Exceptions: Decorative images can have alt="" but should be marked.

Why: Alt text helps accessibility and image search ranking.

## Additional Link Checks (from your rules.txt)

Key pages reachable within 3 clicks from home (WARN)
- Important pages should be easily discoverable

Anchor text quality (WARN)
- Avoid generic "click here" repeated across site
- Use descriptive anchor text

## Performance Hints for Assets

Flag huge HTML payloads (> 1MB)
Flag missing width/height on images (CLS risk)
Flag too many JS files on marketing pages
Flag render-blocking scripts in <head> without defer

---

## Image Best Practices

- Use descriptive file names (product-photo.jpg vs IMG_1234.jpg)
- Compress images appropriately
- Use modern formats (WebP) with fallbacks
- Include width and height attributes to prevent layout shift
- Use lazy loading for below-the-fold images
