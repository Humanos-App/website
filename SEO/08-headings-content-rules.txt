# Headings and Content Rules
# Page structure and content quality

---

## RULE: headings.single_h1
Severity: WARN

Each page should have exactly ONE <h1> tag.

Applies to: text/html
Required count: 1

Why: H1 signals the main topic of the page. Multiple H1s dilute this signal.

---

## RULE: headings.no_empty_h1
Severity: CRITICAL

H1 must not be empty or too short.

Applies to: text/html
Minimum characters: 3

Why: Empty H1 tags provide no SEO value and indicate broken content.

---

## RULE: headings.logical_hierarchy
Severity: WARN

Heading hierarchy should be logical (no skipping levels).

Applies to: text/html
Max level jump: 1

Good:  H1 -> H2 -> H3 -> H2 -> H3
Bad:   H1 -> H3 (skipped H2)
Bad:   H1 -> H4 (skipped H2 and H3)

Why: Logical heading structure helps search engines understand content hierarchy.

---

## RULE: content.min_body_text
Severity: WARN

Pages should have minimum visible body text.

Applies to: text/html
Minimum characters: 250
Ignore sections: nav, footer, header

Why: Thin content (very little text) is considered low quality by search engines.

## Content Best Practices

- H1 should match or relate to <title>
- Use H2s for main sections
- Use H3s for subsections within H2s
- Don't use headings just for styling (use CSS instead)
- Ensure main content is in HTML, not rendered only via JavaScript
- Avoid hidden text (display:none with SEO keywords)
